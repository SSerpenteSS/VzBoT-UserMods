This a collection with  all the necessary printed parts to put Klicky probe on VzBot . 
My only personal contribution is the probe dock mount that i made to fit VzBot , all the other parts are not my creation . 
I made the probe dock mount  with press fit m3 nuts instead of heat inserts used in  the original klicky design. 
In case of collision i added 2 more versions : one 1 mm lower and one 1 mm higher . 

Klicky probe is a cheap and more precise alternative to various probe sensors (BlTouch, 3dTouch, inductive/capacitive sensors ) ,
and tested by me a standard deviation of 0.00065
There are 4 parts needed  : probe mount , probe (vorious probe lenghts  and even a switch extender if needed can be found on the klicky github) , 
probe dock and probe dock mount. On the klicky git magnet press fit helpers can be found , even if i think are useless. 
Inside the pictures folder i will put the print orientation. For the print settings i use a 0.2 layer height, 3 walls,5 top/bottom and 35% infill. 

All the credits go to klicky probe creator and obvious to VzBot creators. 
Original klicky probe repository  and bom can be found here : https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe . 
Take your time and lose some 10 minutes of your life to read the instructions .. could save you hours of useless work. 
To make klicky probe work,  klipper macros need to be installed  from : https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/tree/main/Klipper_macros . 
There are also the instructions to configure the macros. 
A good assembly  guide can be found here :  https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/tree/main/Printers/Ratrig/VCore3
